# ASU Lab Theme for WordPress #

This theme for WordPress is intended to help speed the publishing and maintenance process of small lab groups on campus. It features specific templates for some of the most common use cases of a lab group website including:

- Profile pages for individual contributors
- A ready made directory page to easily contact a member of your lab group.
- A page template for a specific research project.
- A template which talks about the general research themes of your lab.
- Features for "key" publications from the lab as they relate to an individual research project.

## Getting Started ##

For now, if you want to use this theme, you need to fill out a project request form for ASU Engineering. An offering available to the whole university is in the works.

(The homepage content can be edited as markdown in _includes/index.html or directly within the index.html file.)
