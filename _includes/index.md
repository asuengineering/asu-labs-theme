# ASU Lab Theme for WordPress #
{: .page-title}

This theme for WordPress is intended to help speed the publishing and maintenance process of small lab groups on campus. It features specific templates for some of the most common use cases of a lab group website including:

- Profile pages for individual contributors
- A ready made directory page to easily contact a member of your lab group.
- A page template for a specific research project.
- A template which talks about the general research themes of your lab.
- Features for "key" publications from the lab as they relate to an individual research project.
