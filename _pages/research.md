It is easy to quickly create a series of pages that focus on the active and completed research projects that are worked on by members of your lab.

## Organization ##

Research project pages can be categorized together under one unifying research topic. To accomplish this, be sure to assign the page to most appropriate research topic category. Categories can be created "on the fly" within the post editor and can be edited in the Research Topics screen in the admin area.

## Research Project Details ##

In addition to the page title and general description area, the following information can be added to each research project page.

### Funding Source / Funding Company ###

If the project was funded by an external source, you can highlight their contribution by including a link, an image or plain text within the **Funding Source** meta box below the main content editing space.

**Note**{:.label .label-yellow} Use standard HTML markup to include items other than plain text in these areas.

### Status ###

By default, each research project is given a status of **Active** when the page is initially published. This information is found immediately under the title on the project page as well as within most other references to projects in other templates.

Your research project can have one of five states:

- Active
- Ongoing
- Completed
- Pending Publication
- Published

### Research Poster (PDF Only) ###

If your research project has an associated poster (from a conference, symposium or capstone presentation, for example), you can upload and attach it to the project page. It will appear as an entry in the sidebar.
