The individual profiles within the site are compiled together to form a directory page automatically.

## Organization ##

Individuals are grouped together within the directory based on how you classify them within the Lab Roles taxonomy. Within those groupings, you can organize the individual profile links as you see fit. Just drag and drop the individual entries on the All People screen. 

**Note**{:.label .label-yellow} Drag and drop functionality is enabled by a plugin called Intuitive Post Order that comes bundled with the ASU Engineering's standard deployment of this theme.

**Info**{:.label .label-blue} This order can be set manually by accessing the Quick Edit screen from All People, or directly within the post itself from People Attributes in the sidebar.

## Key Profiles ##

Within each organization, people belonging to a particular **Faculty/Student Type** can be highlighted as the "featured" point of contact for the lab. Their entries will be formatted differently and will appear at the top of the directory page.

To mark a particular lab role as a **featured** role, search for the correct term in the Lab Role taxonomy and enable the checkbox marked "Display as a Featured Person."
