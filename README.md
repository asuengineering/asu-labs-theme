# ASU Labs Theme

A theme for WordPress to help build and organize small group websites. Ideal for engineering "lab" groups on campus.

## Description

This theme brings to life several templates and custom post types that we commonly found within our collection of working small & medium sized lab groups. It is a parent theme and includes the following assets.

- ASU Header and Footer, version 4.6
- Font Awesome Pro, version 5.2
- Google Font "Roboto", part of the ASU Web Standards.
- Carbon Fields v3.0, loaded as a part of the theme.

## Requirements

To form the relationships needed between our custom post types, this theme requires the use of a plugin called [Posts 2 Posts](https://github.com/asuengineering/wp-posts-to-posts). 

- It's an oldie but a goodie. Still working within WP 5.0, even if the original was abandoned in 2016.
- ASU Engineering maintains an active fork of the original plugin to deal with any "breakage" that might occur over time.
