<h1 id="asulabstheme">ASU Labs Theme</h1>

<p>A theme for WordPress to help build and organize small group websites. Ideal for engineering &#8220;lab&#8221; groups on campus.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This theme brings to life several templates and custom post types that we commonly found within our collection of working small &amp; medium sized lab groups. It is a parent theme and includes the following assets.</p>

<ul>
<li>ASU Header and Footer, version 4.6</li>
<li>Font Awesome Pro, version 5.2</li>
<li>Google Font &#8220;Roboto&#8221;, part of the ASU Web Standards.</li>
<li>Carbon Fields v3.0, loaded as a part of the theme.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>To form the relationships needed between our custom post types, this theme requires the use of a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/asuengineering/wp-posts-to-posts">Posts 2 Posts</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s an oldie but a goodie. Still working within WP 5.0, even if the original was abandoned in 2016.</li>
<li>ASU Engineering maintains an active fork of the original plugin to deal with any &#8220;breakage&#8221; that might occur over time.</li>
</ul>
